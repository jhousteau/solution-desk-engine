# 11-Phase Technical Sales Methodology

## Overview

The solution-desk-engine framework implements a proven 11-phase methodology for technical sales engagements, transforming source materials into professional deliverables through intelligent document selection and generation.

## Core Principle

**We ALWAYS create our own documents to our standards. Source materials are inputs, not replacements.**

This framework analyzes source materials, identifies target requirements, and intelligently selects the minimum viable set of documents needed to bridge the gap from source to target deliverable.

## The 11 Phases

## Intelligent Document Selection

The framework uses intelligent analysis to determine which documents are required for any given source-to-target transformation:

### Selection Algorithm
1. **Source Analysis**: Extract all available information from phase 0
2. **Target Analysis**: Understand requirements of target deliverable (typically phase 9)
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify what information/analysis is missing
4. **Path Optimization**: Select minimum viable document set to fill gaps
5. **YAML Configuration**: Use `research-documents-config.yaml` to control generation

### Example Selection Logic
```
IF source = "Basic POC Requirements" AND target = "Google DAF SOW":
    MUST_HAVE = [
        1-research/roi-patterns.md,
        2-requirements/functional-requirements.md,
        4-business-case/roi-analysis.md,
        5-architecture/pov-architecture.md,
        7-implementation-plan/timeline-and-resources.md
    ]
    CONDITIONAL = [
        1-research/market-analysis.md IF financial data missing,
        3-analysis/stakeholder-mapping.md IF multi-department impact
    ]
    SKIP = [
        6-solution-design/* (too detailed for POV),
        10-audit/* (not needed for initial SOW)
    ]
```

## Configuration System

The framework uses YAML configuration to control document generation:

- **Master Configuration**: `templates/config/research-documents-config-template.yaml`
- **Project Configuration**: `opportunities/{client}/{project}/research-documents-config.yaml`
- **Status Tracking**: `research-documents-status.yaml`

Each document can be:
- `true` - Generate this document
- `false` - Skip this document
- `conditional` - Generate based on intelligent analysis

## Quality Standards

All generated documents must meet:
- **Citation Requirements**: All financial claims must be sourced
- **Professional Standards**: Consistent formatting and branding
- **Technical Accuracy**: Validated by subject matter experts
- **Completeness**: All required sections properly filled
- **Traceability**: Clear links between source materials and outputs

## Framework Assets

- **Templates**: ~300 document templates in `/templates/documents/`
- **Configuration**: YAML schemas for controlling generation
- **Best Practices**: Proven methodologies and citation standards
- **Export Infrastructure**: Multi-format conversion (PDF, DOCX, Google Docs)
- **Quality Validation**: Automated checks and manual review processes

This methodology has been proven in real engagements and provides a systematic approach to transforming raw opportunities into professional deliverables.
