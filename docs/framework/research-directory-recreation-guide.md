# Research Directory Recreation Guide

> **For AI Agents**: See `AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` for quick-start guidance on using this framework.

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive template for recreating the research directory structure used in complex technical projects. The structure follows a logical progression from raw source materials through analysis, design, and implementation planning, ensuring thorough documentation and traceability throughout the project lifecycle.

## Core Philosophy

The research directory structure is based on three key principles:

1. **Sequential Development**: Each phase builds upon the previous one
2. **Quality Assurance**: Continuous validation against source materials
3. **Business Alignment**: All technical decisions tied to business value

## Directory Structure Template

```
