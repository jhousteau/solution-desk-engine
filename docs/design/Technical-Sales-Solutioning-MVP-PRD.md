# Product Requirements Document: Technical Sales Solutioning Tool - Lean MVP

## Executive Summary

A command-line tool that transforms customer requirements into professional solution proposals through AI-assisted analysis and structured document generation. The MVP focuses on the core workflow: requirements in → intelligent analysis → professional proposal out.

## MVP Scope & Constraints

### Success Criteria
- **Primary Goal**: Generate first usable proposal within 2-4 weeks of development
- **Success Metric**: Successfully process 1 real opportunity end-to-end
- **Quality Gate**: Output requires minimal manual editing before client delivery

### Lean Principles Applied
- **Single workflow path** - No configuration options or variations
- **Convention over configuration** - Opinionated defaults
- **Essential features only** - Defer everything non-critical
- **Immediate utility** - Must be useful from day one

## Problem Statement (MVP Focused)

**Core Pain Point**: Converting messy customer requirements (RFPs, emails, PDFs) into professional technical proposals takes weeks and varies in quality.

**MVP Solution**: Automated analysis + structured generation = professional proposal in hours, not weeks.

## User Journey (MVP)

### Single Happy Path
1. **Input**: `solution create penske --source requirements.pdf`
2. **Analysis**: Tool analyzes requirements and researches context
3. **Generation**: Creates structured proposal documents
4. **Output**: `solution export --format pdf`
5. **Result**: Professional proposal ready for client delivery

### User Commands (Complete MVP Interface)
```bash
# Core workflow - only 4 commands needed
solution create <opportunity-name> --source <file>
solution status
solution generate
solution export --format pdf
```

## MVP Architecture

### Simplified 3-Phase Approach
Instead of 11 phases, MVP uses 3 essential phases:

**Phase 1: Analyze**
- Parse source documents
- Extract requirements
- Research gaps and context

**Phase 2: Design**
- Generate solution architecture
- Create business case
- Develop implementation approach

**Phase 3: Package**
- Compile professional proposal
- Export in client-ready format

### Components (Minimal)

```

```

## Features: In vs Out

### ✅ MVP Must-Have Features

**Core Workflow**
- Document upload and parsing (PDF, Word, text)
- Requirement extraction and analysis
- Basic research agent for context gathering
- Template-based proposal generation
- PDF export

**Essential CLI Commands**
- `create` - Initialize new opportunity
- `status` - Show progress
- `generate` - Run analysis and generation
- `export` - Output final proposal

**Quality Essentials**
- Basic validation (missing sections, broken links)
- Simple progress tracking
- Error handling and recovery

### ❌ MVP Explicitly Out of Scope

**Advanced Features** (Future versions)
- Multiple proposal templates
- Phase-by-phase execution control
- Collaborative editing
- Integration with external systems
- Advanced configuration options
- Multiple output formats
- Custom agent behaviors

**Complex Workflows**
- Multi-user access
- Version control integration
- Approval workflows
- Template customization
- Industry specialization

## MVP Technical Requirements

### Input Handling
- **Supported formats**: PDF, Word, plain text
- **Max document size**: 50MB
- **Processing**: Extract text, identify structure, parse requirements

### Research Agent (Minimal)
- **Web search** for company and industry context
- **Gap identification** in requirements
- **Basic competitive intelligence**
- **Cost/pricing research**

### Output Generation
- **Single template**: Professional proposal format
- **Required sections**: Executive Summary, Solution Overview, Architecture, Timeline, Pricing
- **Export formats**: PDF (primary), Markdown (debug)

### Performance Goals
- **Analysis time**: < 5 minutes for typical RFP
- **Generation time**: < 2 minutes for standard proposal
- **Total time**: Requirements to final PDF < 10 minutes

## Success Metrics (MVP)

### Quantitative Measures
- **Time reduction**: 90% faster than manual process (hours vs weeks)
- **Completion rate**: 100% of sections populated with relevant content
- **Accuracy**: 80% of generated content requires no edits
- **Reliability**: 95% success rate without errors

### Qualitative Measures
- **Usability**: Single user can complete full workflow without documentation
- **Quality**: Generated proposal meets professional standards
- **Utility**: Output is client-ready with minimal customization

## MVP User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard RFP Response
```bash
# Input: 50-page RFP document
solution create acme-rfp --source rfp-document.pdf

# Tool analyzes requirements, researches Acme Corp
# Generates: 15-page professional proposal

solution export --format pdf
# Output: proposal-acme-rfp.pdf ready for client
```

### Scenario 2: Email-based Requirements
```bash
# Input: Email thread with scattered requirements
solution create startup-migration --source email-requirements.txt

# Tool extracts needs, researches startup best practices
# Generates: Focused solution proposal

solution export --format pdf
# Output: Tailored proposal for startup environment
```

## Development Timeline (4-Week Sprint)

### Week 1: Foundation
- CLI framework and basic commands
- Document parsing (PDF/Word)
- Simple requirement extraction

### Week 2: Research Agent
- Web search integration
- Basic company research
- Gap identification logic

### Week 3: Generation Engine
- Template system
- Content generation
- Basic proposal structure

### Week 4: Polish & Export
- PDF export functionality
- Error handling
- End-to-end testing with real opportunity

## Validation Approach

### MVP Testing Strategy
- **Week 2**: Test with simple requirements document
- **Week 3**: Validate generation quality with sample RFP
- **Week 4**: Full end-to-end test with real client opportunity

### Success Validation
MVP is successful when:
1. **Single command workflow** produces usable output
2. **Generated proposal** requires < 2 hours manual editing
3. **Client delivery ready** with professional appearance
4. **Time savings** demonstrates clear value over manual process

## Post-MVP Roadmap Priorities

1. **Multiple templates** - Industry-specific proposal formats
2. **Enhanced research** - Deeper competitive intelligence
3. **Iterative refinement** - User feedback incorporation
4. **Advanced export** - PowerPoint, custom branding
5. **Integration capabilities** - CRM connections

## Definition of MVP Success

The MVP succeeds when a technical sales engineer can input customer requirements via CLI and receive a professional, comprehensive proposal document that requires minimal editing before client delivery - completing in hours what previously took weeks.

**Success Signal**: First real client proposal generated and delivered using the MVP tool within 30 days of development completion.
