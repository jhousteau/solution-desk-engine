## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Consumption Commitment Risks

**Primary Risk**: Not meeting $25K Year 1 ARR minimum
- **Mitigation**: Conservative projections show $[AMOUNT] ARR ([PERCENTAGE]% above minimum)
- **Buffer**: Multiple consumption drivers ensure commitment achievement

**Secondary Risk**: TCV falling below $100K over 3 years
- **Mitigation**: Total projected TCV of $[AMOUNT] provides significant buffer
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed for consumption growth beyond minimums

**Cost Overrun Risk**: Exceeding budgeted consumption
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive monitoring and automated controls
- **Contingency**: [PERCENTAGE]% budget buffer for unexpected growth

### Technical Risk Mitigation
- **Service Availability**: Multi-region deployment for high availability
- **Performance**: Auto-scaling and load balancing for consistent performance
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security controls and compliance frameworks
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Portable architecture design and multi-cloud considerations
