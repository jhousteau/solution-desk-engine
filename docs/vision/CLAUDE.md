# solution-desk-engine Vision & Context

This directory contains project vision, goals, and strategic context that should guide all development decisions.

## Project Vision

**Mission**: A solution-desk-engine project created with Genesis

## Target Users

Define your primary user personas and their needs:
- **Developer**: Building applications with this service
- **Operator**: Deploying and maintaining this service
- **End User**: Consuming functionality through applications

## Success Metrics

Define how you measure project success:
- Performance targets (latency, throughput)
- Quality goals (uptime, error rates)
- Developer experience (setup time, documentation clarity)

## Core Constraints

Document fundamental constraints that shape all decisions:
- **Security**: No hardcoded secrets, fail-fast configuration
- **Performance**: Response times, resource usage limits
- **Scalability**: Concurrent user targets, data volume limits
- **Compatibility**: Supported platforms, API versioning

## Strategic Priorities

Rank your priorities when making tradeoffs:
1. **Security & Reliability** - Never compromise on safety
2. **Developer Experience** - Clear APIs, good documentation
3. **Performance** - Optimize for common use cases
4. **Feature Completeness** - Build what users actually need

## Non-Goals

Explicitly document what this project will NOT do to maintain focus:
- Complex workflow orchestration (use dedicated tools)
- General-purpose data processing (focused on specific domain)
- Multi-tenancy (single-tenant design for now)

**Context for AI Assistants**: Use this vision to guide feature development, architectural decisions, and code quality standards. When in doubt, prioritize the strategic priorities listed above.
