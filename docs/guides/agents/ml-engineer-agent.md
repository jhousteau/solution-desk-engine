# Continuous deployment pipeline for ML models
class MLDeploymentPipeline:
    def __init__(self, project_id: str):
        self.project_id = project_id
        self.vertex_ai = aiplatform.init(project=project_id)

    def deploy_model_canary(self, model_resource_name: str) -> str:
        """Deploy model with canary strategy"""

        # Create endpoint if doesn't exist
        endpoint = self._get_or_create_endpoint("document-classifier")

        # Deploy new model version with 10% traffic
        deployed_model = endpoint.deploy(
            model=model_resource_name,
            deployed_model_display_name=f"v{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M')}",
            traffic_percentage=10,
            machine_type="n1-standard-2",
            min_replica_count=1,
            max_replica_count=5
        )

        # Monitor performance for 24 hours
        self._schedule_performance_monitoring(deployed_model.id)

        return deployed_model.resource_name

    def promote_model_version(self, deployed_model_id: str):
        """Promote canary to full traffic after validation"""
        endpoint = self._get_endpoint("document-classifier")

        # Gradually increase traffic: 10% -> 50% -> 100%
        traffic_stages = [50, 100]
        for traffic in traffic_stages:
            endpoint.update_traffic_allocation({
                deployed_model_id: traffic,
                "previous_version": 100 - traffic
            })
            time.sleep(3600)  # Wait 1 hour between stages
```

## Model Monitoring and Observability
### Performance Monitoring
```python
class ModelMonitoringSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.monitoring_client = monitoring_v3.MetricServiceClient()
        self.project_path = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}"

    def track_model_performance(self, model_name: str, predictions: List[Dict]):
        """Track model performance metrics"""

        # Accuracy tracking
        accuracy = self._calculate_accuracy(predictions)
        self._write_metric("model_accuracy", accuracy, {"model": model_name})

        # Latency tracking
        avg_latency = self._calculate_latency(predictions)
        self._write_metric("inference_latency", avg_latency, {"model": model_name})

        # Confidence distribution
        confidence_scores = [p.get("confidence", 0) for p in predictions]
        avg_confidence = sum(confidence_scores) / len(confidence_scores)
        self._write_metric("prediction_confidence", avg_confidence, {"model": model_name})

        # Data drift detection
        feature_drift = self._detect_feature_drift(predictions)
        self._write_metric("feature_drift_score", feature_drift, {"model": model_name})

    def setup_alerting_rules(self):
        """Configure alerting for model performance degradation"""

        alert_policies = [
            {
                "name": "Model Accuracy Drop",
                "condition": "model_accuracy < 0.85",
                "notification": "email:ml-team@company.com"
            },
            {
                "name": "High Inference Latency",
                "condition": "inference_latency > 2000",  # 2 seconds
                "notification": "slack:#ml-alerts"
            },
            {
                "name": "Data Drift Detected",
                "condition": "feature_drift_score > 0.3",
                "notification": "email:data-team@company.com"
            }
        ]

        for policy in alert_policies:
            self._create_alert_policy(policy)
```

## Model Optimization Strategies
### Performance Optimization
- **Model Quantization**: 8-bit quantization for inference speed
- **Model Pruning**: Remove redundant parameters for smaller models
- **Batch Inference**: Process multiple documents in single API calls
- **Caching**: Cache frequent predictions and embeddings

### Resource Optimization
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale endpoints based on request volume
- **GPU Utilization**: Optimize GPU usage for embedding generation
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage for large document processing
- **Cost Optimization**: Use preemptible instances for training workloads

## A/B Testing Framework
### Experiment Design
```python
class ABTestingFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        self.experiment_tracker = ExperimentTracker()

    def run_model_experiment(self,
                           model_a: str,
                           model_b: str,
                           traffic_split: float = 0.5):
        """Run A/B test between two model versions"""

        experiment = {
            "name": f"model_comparison_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')}",
            "model_a": model_a,
            "model_b": model_b,
            "traffic_split": traffic_split,
            "start_date": datetime.now(),
            "duration_days": 14,
            "success_metrics": ["accuracy", "latency", "user_satisfaction"],
            "minimum_sample_size": 1000
        }

        # Deploy both models with traffic splitting
        self._deploy_ab_test_models(experiment)

        # Track experiment results
        self.experiment_tracker.start_experiment(experiment)

        return experiment["name"]

    def analyze_experiment_results(self, experiment_name: str) -> Dict:
        """Analyze A/B test results and provide recommendations"""

        results = self.experiment_tracker.get_results(experiment_name)

        analysis = {
            "statistical_significance": self._calculate_significance(results),
            "winner": self._determine_winner(results),
            "confidence_interval": self._calculate_confidence_interval(results),
            "recommendation": self._generate_recommendation(results)
        }

        return analysis
