   - **Impact**: High ($[Amount] potential overrun)
   - **Mitigation**: Automated scaling limits, real-time monitoring
   - **Contingency**: Emergency budget override process

2. **GCP Pricing Changes**
   - **Probability**: Low
   - **Impact**: Medium (+15% potential cost increase)
   - **Mitigation**: Committed Use Discounts, contract terms
   - **Contingency**: Alternative platform evaluation

3. **Project Scope Expansion**
   - **Probability**: High
   - **Impact**: High (Budget increase required)
   - **Mitigation**: Change control process, budget re-approval
   - **Contingency**: Phased implementation to manage costs

#### Risk Monitoring Process
- **Weekly**: Review usage trends for early warning indicators
- **Monthly**: Assess external factors (pricing changes, market conditions)
- **Quarterly**: Update risk register and mitigation strategies
