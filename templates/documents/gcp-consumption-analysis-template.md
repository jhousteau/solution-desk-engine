  ai_enhanced_queries: "$12.00 per 1,000 queries × [Volume] = $[Annual]"
  enterprise_features: "$[Amount]/month × 12 months = $[Annual]"

Total_Year_1_ARR: "$[Amount] (exceeds $25K DAF minimum)"
Total_Contract_Value: "$[Amount] over 3 years (exceeds $100K DAF minimum)"
```

#### POV Phase Consumption (DAF Covered)

**Volume Assumptions**
- **Daily Conversations**: [Number] conversations/day
- **Business Days**: 30 days (6 weeks × 5 days)
- **Total Consumption**: $[Amount] (eligible for up to $50K DAF funding)

### Year 1 Production Consumption - ARR Target

**Monthly Consumption Growth**
```yaml
Quarter_1: "$[Amount]/month (ramp-up phase)"
Quarter_2: "$[Amount]/month (scaling phase)"
Quarter_3: "$[Amount]/month (optimization phase)"
Quarter_4: "$[Amount]/month (full scale)"

Year_1_Total_ARR: "$[Amount] (exceeds $25K minimum)"
Monthly_Average: "$[Amount]/month sustained consumption"
```

**Key Consumption Drivers**
- Conversation volume scaling from [Number] to [Number] monthly
- Enterprise feature adoption driving premium pricing tiers
- AI-enhanced query growth supporting higher consumption rates

### Production Phase Cost Projections

#### Scaling Assumptions
- **Year 1**: [Number] conversations/month growing to [Number]/month
- **Year 2**: [Number] conversations/month average
- **Year 3**: [Number] conversations/month average

#### Production Cost Model
```yaml
Year_1_Costs:
  ces_platform:
    base_subscription: "$[Amount]/month"
    conversation_volume: "$[Amount]/month (average)"
    premium_features: "$[Amount]/month"

  infrastructure:
    compute_engine: "$[Amount]/month with CUDs"
    cloud_storage: "$[Amount]/month with lifecycle policies"
    data_processing: "$[Amount]/month"
    monitoring: "$[Amount]/month"

  integration_costs:
    api_gateway: "$[Amount]/month"
    third_party_connectors: "$[Amount]/month"

  total_monthly: "$[Amount]"
  total_annual: "$[Amount]"
```

## Basic Cost Management

### Essential Optimizations for DAF Compliance
- **Committed Use Discounts**: Implement for predictable workloads to maximize consumption efficiency
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track consumption against ARR commitments
- **Scaling Controls**: Ensure consumption growth aligns with business expansion

## Total Contract Value (TCV) Analysis - DAF Focus

### 3-Year Consumption Commitment
```yaml
DAF_Qualification_Metrics:
  year_1_arr: "$[Amount] (exceeds $25K minimum)"
  year_2_projected: "$[Amount] (growth trajectory)"
  year_3_projected: "$[Amount] (mature scale)"

  total_3_year_tcv: "$[Amount] (exceeds $100K minimum)"
  average_annual_consumption: "$[Amount]/year"

DAF_Funding_Eligibility:
  daf_funding_available: "$[Amount] (5% of Year 1 ARR, max $50K)"
  pov_coverage: "100% of POV costs covered by DAF"
  net_investment_after_daf: "$[Amount] for Year 1 implementation"
```

**Key TCV Components:**
- Platform subscription and usage fees
- Infrastructure consumption (compute, storage, networking)
- Enterprise feature licensing
- Support and maintenance services

## DAF Risk Mitigation

### Consumption Commitment Risks

**Primary Risk**: Not meeting $25K Year 1 ARR minimum
- **Mitigation**: Conservative projections show $[Amount] ARR (X% above minimum)
- **Buffer**: Multiple consumption drivers ensure commitment achievement

**Secondary Risk**: TCV falling below $100K over 3 years
- **Mitigation**: Total projected TCV of $[Amount] provides significant buffer
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed for consumption growth beyond minimums

## ROI Calculation with GCP Consumption

### Investment Summary
- **POV Investment**: $[Amount] (6 weeks)
- **Year 1 Total Investment**: $[Amount] (development + platform)
- **Ongoing Annual Costs**: $[Amount] (platform + optimization)

### Revenue Impact
- **Current F&I Revenue**: $[Amount]/year⁵
- **Projected Revenue Increase**: +[X]% through improved attachment rates
- **Additional Annual Revenue**: +$[Amount]/year

### Cost Savings
- **Personnel Cost Reduction**: $[Amount]/year through automation⁶
