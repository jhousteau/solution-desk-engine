# Comprehensive GCP Consumption Calculation Guide

## Executive Summary

This guide provides enterprise organizations with comprehensive methodologies for calculating Google Cloud Platform (GCP) consumption, cost forecasting, and optimization strategies. It covers billing models, calculation frameworks, tools, APIs, and best practices for accurate consumption planning and cost management at scale.

## GCP Billing & Pricing Models Overview

### 1. Core Pricing Models (2025)

#### Pay-as-You-Go Model
```yaml
Pay_As_You_Go:
  description: "Charges only for resources consumed"
  billing_frequency: "Monthly"
  calculation_basis: "Per-second billing (10-minute minimum)"
  advantages:
    - no_upfront_costs
    - no_termination_fees
    - flexible_scaling
    - granular_billing

  best_for:
    - variable_workloads
    - development_environments
    - unpredictable_usage_patterns
```

#### Committed Use Discounts (CUDs)
```yaml
Committed_Use_Discounts:
  types:
    resource_based:
      commitment: "Specific instance types/families"
      discount: "Up to 57% savings"
      terms: ["1-year", "3-year"]

    spend_based:
      commitment: "Minimum spend per hour"
      discount: "Up to 25% savings"
      flexibility: "Any eligible services"

  calculation_method: "Hourly commitment × discount rate"
  best_for: "Predictable, consistent workloads"
```

#### Sustained Use Discounts (SUDs)
```yaml
Sustained_Use_Discounts:
  type: "Automatic discounts"
  trigger: "Extended resource usage"
  discount_tiers:
    "25-50%_usage": "20% discount"
    "50-75%_usage": "40% discount"
    "75-100%_usage": "60% discount"

  calculation: "Incremental discount on usage tiers"
  eligibility: "Compute Engine resources"
```

#### Preemptible/Spot VM Pricing
```yaml
Preemptible_Pricing:
  discount: "Up to 91% savings"
  limitation: "30-second termination notice"
  availability: "Subject to capacity"
  calculation: "Standard price × (1 - discount_rate)"

  risk_factors:
    - workload_interruption
    - availability_uncertainty
    - restart_overhead_costs
```

### 2. Service-Specific Pricing Models

#### Compute Engine Consumption Calculation
```javascript
// Compute Engine Cost Calculation
function calculateComputeEngineConsumption(config) {
  const {
    machineType,
    hours,
    region,
    diskSizeGB,
    networkGB,
    committedUse = false,
    preemptible = false
  } = config;

  // Base compute cost
  let computeCost = machineType.vCPUs * machineType.cpuPrice * hours +
                    machineType.memoryGB * machineType.memoryPrice * hours;

  // Apply discounts
  if (preemptible) computeCost *= 0.2; // Up to 80% discount
  if (committedUse) computeCost *= 0.43; // Up to 57% discount

  // Storage cost
  const storageCost = diskSizeGB * 0.04; // $0.04/GB/month

  // Network cost
  const networkCost = networkGB * 0.12; // $0.12/GB egress

  return {
    compute: computeCost,
    storage: storageCost,
    network: networkCost,
    total: computeCost + storageCost + networkCost
  };
}
```

#### BigQuery Consumption Models
```yaml
BigQuery_Pricing:
  on_demand:
    calculation: "Data processed (TiB) × $6.25/TiB"
    billing: "Per query execution"
    optimization:
      - partition_tables
      - cluster_columns
      - select_specific_columns
      - use_preview_mode

  capacity_based:
    calculation: "Slots × Hours × Slot price"
    billing: "Reserved capacity model"
    editions:
      standard: "$0.04/slot/hour"
      enterprise: "$0.06/slot/hour"
      enterprise_plus: "$0.10/slot/hour"

  storage:
    active: "$0.02/GB/month"
    long_term: "$0.01/GB/month (90+ days)"

  calculation_example: |
    Query processing 5 TiB data:
    Cost = 5 TiB × $6.25 = $31.25
```

#### Storage Consumption Calculation
```yaml
Cloud_Storage_Pricing:
  storage_classes:
    standard:
      cost_per_gb: "$0.020/GB/month"
      retrieval_cost: "Free"
      operations: "$0.05/10k operations"

    nearline:
      cost_per_gb: "$0.010/GB/month"
      retrieval_cost: "$0.01/GB"
      minimum_duration: "30 days"

    coldline:
      cost_per_gb: "$0.004/GB/month"
      retrieval_cost: "$0.05/GB"
      minimum_duration: "90 days"

    archive:
      cost_per_gb: "$0.0012/GB/month"
      retrieval_cost: "$0.50/GB"

    chatQueries,          // Number of chat conversations
    voiceMinutes,         // Total voice call minutes
    agentsCount,          // Number of live agents using Agent Assist
    conversationsAnalyzed // Analytics processing volume
  } = usage;

  // Conversational Agents cost
  const chatCost = (chatQueries / 1000) * 7.00;
  const voiceCost = (voiceMinutes * 60) * 0.002; // Convert to seconds

  // Agent Assist cost (estimated)
  const agentAssistCost = agentsCount * 50; // $50/agent/month estimate

  // CCaaS cost (estimated)
  const ccaasCost = voiceMinutes * 0.03; // $0.03/minute estimate

  // Conversational Insights cost (estimated)
  const insightsCost = (conversationsAnalyzed / 1000) * 2.00;

  return {
    conversationalAgents: chatCost + voiceCost,
    agentAssist: agentAssistCost,
    ccaas: ccaasCost,
    insights: insightsCost,
    total: chatCost + voiceCost + agentAssistCost + ccaasCost + insightsCost
  };
